# Become Spiderman !!

Uncle Ben's death changes everything for you. You realize that with your powers comes a responsibility to use them the right way. After stopping the robber by turning him over to the authorities, you understand that being a hero isn’t about anger or revenge—it’s about making the right choices. Uncle Ben’s final words echo in your mind: with great power comes great responsibility. That’s when you fully embrace being Spider-Man, not just because of your abilities, but because you now understand what it truly means to protect others.

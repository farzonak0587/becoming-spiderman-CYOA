# 1 year and 6 months later

Its been a year since you got bitten by the spider and the first accident of the robbers, luckly you didnt leave them to die. You improved on your skills that you trained, High school is getting rough but nothing to complain about as long they dont catch you.
On the spidey side, its a fun way to destress by stopping criminals, well it used to be small robbers and criminals but now there is more threats. A hunter named Kraven is hunting you sometimes just to prove he is number one. There was scientist named Dr. Conner that study Lizard biology to regrow his missing arm but in doing so it came with a great side effect, he turned to a big lizard. He tried couples of time turning the city into lizards
The first robber you stop, Marko, you catched him more times on robberies but one day he was in a experiment where changed his whole DNA, making him sand. Calling himself SandMan, When you try to talk to him about the accdient and who did it. he only says "It was the Big man"
Doesnt ring a bell but maybe it will be important later on.
The city is corrupt by mafias but its okay because at the end of the day. Your The Amazing Spiderman.

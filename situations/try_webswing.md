Testing out web swinging

"Mmmm Nah, web swinging is cooler" you said (dummy). You went up the shipping containers to get a higher altitude. Your nervous, of course. You put on the web shooters on your wrist and procced to shot the first web fluid, it actually stick to the celling, you jumped of the container and started swinging, you timed it just right to shoot the new shot. You eventually found a rhythm, Shot swing shot. But you timed it next shot wrong and fell down and hit a metal container, getting knocked out.

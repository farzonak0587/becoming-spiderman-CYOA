# Arrived to school

You turned off the car and got ready to go to school. You kissed Uncle Ben and Aunt May goodbye. "Hey, kiddo, let me give you a ride," says Uncle Ben. You agreed, and Uncle Ben drove you to school. Before you left the car, he said, "Peter, you know I care for you... a lot. I know high school can be hard, especially if you don't fit in. But I'm proud of you. I know that you can do amazing things, grow strong. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility."

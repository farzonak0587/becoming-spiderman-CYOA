# Go out for Revenge

Fueled by anger and guilt over Uncle Ben’s death, you finally track down the robber and corner him on a rooftop. He’s scared, begging for his life, but you’re too angry to care. In the heat of the moment, you push him, just wanting him to feel scared like you do. But the push is too hard, and he stumbles, falling off the edge of the building. You stand there in shock, realizing you didn’t mean to kill him. The weight of what you’ve just done hits you all at once, and you’re frozen, unable to process it.

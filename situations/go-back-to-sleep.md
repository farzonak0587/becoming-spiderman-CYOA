You hit snooze and snuggle back into bed. But soon, you hear footsteps approaching your door. The door creaks open, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben walk in, looking at you with concerned faces.

"Aren’t you going to school?" Aunt May asks gently. "You don’t want to miss the trip to the lab. Get up now, or you’ll be late."

Uncle Ben adds, "You know, the day won’t wait for you. Come on, buddy, get moving."

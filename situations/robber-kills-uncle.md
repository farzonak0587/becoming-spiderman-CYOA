# Let the Robber Get Away

You spot the robber again, and this time, your Uncle Ben tries to stop him. As your uncle confronts him, you rush in to help, but the robber pulls out a gun and shoots Uncle Ben in the chest. You try to save him, but it's too late. Before he dies, he gives you the famous warning: "With great power comes great responsibility." The robber escapes, leaving you overwhelmed with guilt, knowing your failure to act earlier led to this tragic outcome.

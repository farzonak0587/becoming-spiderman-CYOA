# Stop the robber the right way

This time, you don’t let your anger control you. You chase the robber down, but you keep your cool and don’t let revenge take over. When you catch him, you grab him, not to hurt him, but to stop him. You hold him there until the cops show up, making sure he gets handed over to the authorities. Watching them take him away, you feel a weight lift off your shoulders, knowing you did the right thing instead of letting your emotions take charge.

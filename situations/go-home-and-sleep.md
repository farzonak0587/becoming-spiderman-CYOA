# Go home becasue you feel sick

You get home, feeling super sick from the spider bite, and crash into bed, hoping some sleep will make you feel better. When you wake up, everything feels off. Your senses are way sharper, like you can hear stuff you never noticed before. You reach for your desk, and your hand sticks to it like it's glued. Freaked out, you pull away and check yourself in the mirror. You feel stronger and faster, like your body’s totally changed. The bite is healed, and it hits you—you’ve got powers now. Now, you’ve got no idea what to do with them.
